# Python Script Execution Guidelines

When running Python scripts in this project, always use the `uv run` command instead of running Python scripts directly:

```bash
# CORRECT WAY ✓
uv run script_name.py --args

# INCORRECT WAY ✗
python script_name.py --args
```

Using `uv run` ensures:
1. All dependencies are properly loaded
2. The correct virtual environment is activated
3. Consistent behavior across different systems

This applies to all scripts, including test files like `test_audio_event_handling.py` and the main `audio_transcribe_elevenlabs_adapted.py` script.
